FIRST OF ALL I HAVE MY CORRECTED VERSION OF MY PART 1 SUBMITTED HERE :

I CHANGED IT ALL BASED TO THE FEEDBACK GIVEN........

FOR:

- Documentation: Assumptions and Constraints [5 Marks] I GOT 4/5 AND MY FEEDBACK WAS : "Consider additional system constraints which may apply"

  IN MY CORRECTED VERSION YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW I FIXED IT AND EXPANDED ON IT

  ==========================================================================================================================================================================================

  FOR:

  - UML Class Diagram for Databases: Accuracy and Completeness [20 Marks] I GOT 15/20 AND MY FEEDBACK WAS: "Camel casing has not been utilized when naming the attributes, redundancy is present in terms of Lecturer, Academic Manager, and Programme Coordinator. Consider creating a User Table with a role type and relating it to the respective other entities"
 
    IN MY CORRECTED VERSION YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW I FIXED IT BY ADDED A COMBINED USER TABLE BUT YOU WILL ALSO SEE WHY I WILL ONLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGE IN PART3 NOT PART 2 BASED ON WHAT YPU WILL READ IN MY DOCUMENT.

   ==============================================================================================================================================================================================

   FOR:

  Project Plan: Realism and Achievability [25 Marks] I GOT 22/25 AND MY FEEDBACK WAS : "Timeline and implemented dates require minor changes in order to be realistic"

  IN MY CORRECTED VERSION YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW I FIXED IT HOW I IMPLEMENTED DATES TO TASKS THAT ARE MORE REALISTIC.

  =============================================================================================================================================================================================

  FOR:

  GUI UI: Design and User-Friendliness [25 Marks] I GOT 20/25 AND MY FEEDBACK WAS : "Approval Process includes verification and then approval. Currently, the lecturer will enter the hourly rate"

  IN MY CORRECTED VERSION I MENTION HOW THIS CHANGE WILL BE VISIBLE THROUGH MY COMMIT MESSAGES AND HOW IT SHOWS I ACHIEVED IT.

  # THIS WAS ALL I HAD TO DECLARE FOR MY CHANGES IN PART 1
